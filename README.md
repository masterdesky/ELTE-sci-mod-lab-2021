# Scientific Modeling Computer Laboratory 2020-2021/2 @ ELTE

This repository contains all my project work for the course "Scientific Modeling Computer Laboratory" during Physics MSc at ELTE, which I've attended in the second semester of the academic year 2020-2021. The `docs` folder contains every files, which were used for the weekly, midterm and final reports. The `project` folder contains the actual source codes and other files necessary to reproduce my simulation results.

## Descriptions
Detailed descriptions for specific folders are presented in the appropriate directories in the `README.md` files of this repository.
