Hello everyone! Now it is my turn to talk about my project work, revolving around the study of the NEBULA neutron detector, supervised by Ákos Horváth.

* slide 1 *
First I would like summarize all my achievements made so far and what exactly I did in the last two weeks, just in a nutshell. I've told you in the last, midterm presentation, that at the beginning of the semester I've first set up the whole development enviroment for Geant4, the software toolkit I'm using for this project. I then learned to use this toolkit at a somewhat basic level, until I was able to successfully implement the focus of my study, the NEBULA detector in Geant4. Later I've also made the first test runs with randomly generated neutron beams and showed you some early visualizations using the OpeanGL+Qt API of Geant4.

In the previous two weeks I've finished basically all of my remaining planned tasks I was intended to do. I gave each detector rods of NEBULA the capability of measuring energies of transiting neutrons individually for a whole simulation, and created the I/O pipeline in Geant4 and then data exploration and data analysis pipeline in the Python 3.9.

That's all I have for you today, so thank you for your attention!
