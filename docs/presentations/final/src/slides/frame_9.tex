\begin{exampleblock}{Achievements}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item As a reference work I've used the BSc thesis of Dávid Pesznyák
		\item Successfully reproduced his results and figures...
		\item ...and also extended them with my own work and ideas
	\end{itemize}
\end{exampleblock}

\begin{block}{Reflections on the project}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The project took a lot of time and was relatively hard to keep up with it, but I think I did handle it relatively well
		\item Extra difficulties were arisen, when I had to interpret some results
		\item Overall it was still an interesting and challenging topic to work on
	\end{itemize}
