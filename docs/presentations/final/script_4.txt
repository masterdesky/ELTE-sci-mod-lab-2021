Hello everyone! I'll now talk about my project, focusing on the study of the NEBULA neutron detector, supervised by Ákos Horváth.

* slide 1 *
As I've mentioned it last time, my intention was to test the NEBULA detector with different, so-called "physics lists" in Geant4. But besides this, I've also implemented a much higher resolution and versatile data gathering method for my simulation. Today I'll talk about these two topics.

First I have to tell you a bit about some of the technical aspect of Geant4. (Again, as almost in all previous lectures.)

Geant4 basically has 3 different levels when it comes to particle tracking. So, Geant4 simulations work just like as almost any other simulation. The time is discretized, and the simulation advances in smaller, discrete steps. That's why the first level of particle tracking is the step level. This is the most versatile particle tracking method, since at every step, we can get acces all of the constantly changing attributes of particles. Like poition, energy, its current mother volume (so is it inside a part of the detector geometry or outside, etc). And there are much more attributes that only available on this level. But we have to be aware, that there a lot of steps happens during a simulation and saving a lot of data in a larger simulation takes up a lot of space on the hard drive.

Because the second level is the "event level". Event in Geant4 is the set of every steps, that taken place during the lifetime of a particle, plus every step, that was caused by the presence of the particle. So eg. if shot a neutron at the detector and another particle is created during some physical process, the steps taken by that created particle will be considered to be in the same event as the neutron was. This is just something I've observed. There could be even more into it, but I didn't really look into this, it wasn't that relevant. On this level we can easily handle only accumulable quantities, such as energies. We can analyse eg. how much energy a neutron lost during its lifetime by broadcasting deposited energy values from the step level and accumulating them on the event level.

And the final level is the "run level", which is the set of all events during a simulation. So this consists everything that happened during a simulation.

* slide 3 *
During the project I've discussed two different approaches to the analysis of data. Last time I've showed you some results achieved from analysing the accumulated energy values on the event level. How they deposited in NEBULA's detector rods and how these accumulated energies were distributed. And now I've worked with the step-level analysis. This made me able to also monitor all the physical processes and particle steps, that happened during the simulation. Determine how many times they occured in the simulation or how much energy they've taken.

The main difference between this two analysis, that when working on the event level, that energies are ranging from zero up to the original particle energies, while on the step level energies will be much smaller. A particle obviously won't deposit as much energy just in one step, than during its full lifetime in total.

* slide 4 *
So as I've mentioned at the beginning, this time I worked on the step level analysis and implemented the use of different physics lists in Geant4. These so-called "physics list" are collections of physical processes. They basically determine what physics Geant4 should use to create a simulation. Of course different physics means different results. Certain physical effects only relevant at lower energies, some only at higher energies. And if we don't choose appropriate physics for our simulation, it will be simply inaccurate.

Here is a figure of the energy deposit values for different physics lists in Geant4. We can see, that there are obviously big differences between different types. One can say, that for neutrons with smaller energies, the physics list with the _HP ending in their names should be used. You can see in the legend of this figure that there are three of them in my case.

* slide 5/1.-2. *
Besides the deposited energy I've also explored the occurence of physical processes in the simulation. I would like to apologize for the small figure labels. Some of the process names are pretty long, that's why they're so small here. First please notice that this is a logarithmic scale. What you would see on this figure is that the three most frequent events are the energy deposit of hadron ionization, the elastic collision of hadrons and the energy deposit of electron ionization. Of course, if the physics list changes, the processes also change. Some processes are dropped, new processes are introduced, proportions are changing around.

* slide 5/3.-4. *
We can also plot the processes by their contribution to the total energy deposit. We can see, that for 100 MeV in case of this simplified NEBULA detector, the hadron ionization deposited the most energy during the simulation, with ion ionization and electron ionization following it on the second and third places. This is so robust, that this distribution was the very same for other processes actually.

* slide 6 *
And for some final notes, I would like to show you, how many different particle STEPS are tracked during the simulation. There are a lot of them. These are not the actual particle numbers, again, these are the number of simulation steps for that specific type of particle.

* Final notes *
Currently I'm running low on ideas about what should I do for the final lecture, but I will obviously consult Ákos, how to end this project. Thank you for your attention!
